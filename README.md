# gore-lang

> Fun Project to write my own language, to learn Go and to see how a good language would look like for me. So it will probably end up like a modern C ... so Go

A statically and strongly typed programming language similar to Go, but with more focus on memory. It is more like a mix of C, Go and Rust. 
It is named Gore, because I took everything out of C, Go and Rust I like to write this bloody mess.
And because it is written in Go...
